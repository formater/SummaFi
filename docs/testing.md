## 2. Test Plans

### 2.1 Unit Testing Plan
Focuses on individual module functionality:

#### Data Processing Tests (`test_data_loader.py`)
- **Scenarios:**
  - Dataset initialization and configuration validation.
  - Data preprocessing correctness.
  - Batch and tensor validation for downstream tasks.
  - Input truncation and error handling checks.

#### GPU Tests (`test_gpu.py`)
- **Scenarios:**
  - GPU availability validation.
  - Memory allocation and cleanup monitoring.
  - Batch inference on GPU and efficiency checks.

#### Article Extraction Tests (`test_article_extractor.py`)
- **Scenarios:**
  - URL validation and error handling for invalid inputs.
  - Content extraction correctness.
  - Response format verification.

#### Sentiment Analysis Tests (`test_sentiment_analyzer.py`)
- **Scenarios:**
  - Positive and negative sentiment detection accuracy.
  - Probability distribution correctness.
  - Text chunking and segmentation integrity.

---

### 2.2 Integration Testing Plan
Covers interaction between major components:

- **Web Interface and Backend Communication**
  - Verify that user inputs (URLs) are correctly sent and processed.
  - Ensure summaries are returned and displayed properly.
  
- **Backend and NLP Model Integration**
  - Validate interaction between backend and summarization models.
  - Ensure outputs are correctly processed and formatted.

- **Error Handling Across Components**
  - Ensure errors (e.g., invalid URLs or model failures) are propagated and handled gracefully.

---

### 2.3 System Testing Plan
Validates the complete system against requirements:

#### Performance Testing
- Measure response times under varying loads.
- Monitor GPU utilization during batch inference.
- Evaluate concurrent request handling capabilities.

#### Security Testing
- Validate URL inputs and sanitize requests.
- Ensure compliance with GDPR through non-persistent data handling.

---

### 2.4 User Acceptance Testing Plan
- **Summary Accuracy**
  - Verify summaries reflect the article's key points, are concise, and ≤25% of the original content length.
  
- **Simplified User Interface**
  - Test user experience for clarity, intuitiveness, and speed.

- **Response Time**
  - Ensure summarization within acceptable time limits (e.g., ≤5 seconds for articles <1000 words).

- **Error Handling**
  - Validate proper messaging for invalid or inaccessible URLs.

---

## 3. Test Cases

### 3.1 Data Processing Test Cases
- **Dataset Initialization**: Validate dataset and tokenizer setup.
- **Preprocessing**: Ensure correct tensor generation and format.

### 3.2 GPU Test Cases
- **Memory Management**: Validate memory allocation and cleanup during batch inference.

### 3.3 Article Extraction Test Cases
- **URL Validation**: Test valid/invalid URL handling.
